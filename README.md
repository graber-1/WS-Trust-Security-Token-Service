INTRODUCTION
------------

This library is able to get Security tokens from Agiv-STS service
and use them in service classes.

Agiv-STS is a WS-Trust based security token service.

So far we have one class to access the Gipod service.


ADDITIONAL INFO
---------------

Important note:

When executing Gipod methods, parameter order is important
and must be the same as on Gipod docs page.
